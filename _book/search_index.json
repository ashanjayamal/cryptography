Alice need to send a valuable item to Bob through post. However, there is no guarantee that the item will not be stolen while in transit. How can Alice and Bob can come up with a secure way to send the item through the post? What is your solution? Can you improve your solution? What is Cryptography? Cryptography (cryptology) is the (mathematical) science of techniques for secure communication in the presence of an adversary. 1.1 Substitution ciphers 1.2 Cryptographic goals 1.3 Basic terminology and concepts 1.4 Symmetric-key encryption 1.5 Introduction to cryptoanalysis "],["hello-bookdown.html", "Chapter 2 Hello bookdown 2.1 A section", " Chapter 2 Hello bookdown All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 2.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.
